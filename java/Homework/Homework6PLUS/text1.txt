Oh      my love my darling

I have hungered for your touch

A long lonely time
And time goes by so slowly

and time can do so much

Are you still mine


I need your love

I need your love

God        speed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow to the sea to the sea

To the open arms of the sea

Lonely river sigh wait for me wait for me

I will be coming home

Wait for me

Oh my love my darling

I have hungered hungered for your touch

A long lonely time

And time goes by so slowly yet time can do so much

Are you still mine

I need your love I need your love

God speed your love to me
