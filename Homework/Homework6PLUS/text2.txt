Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight
OH Jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells jingle bells

Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
A day or two ago
I thought I take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
He has got into a drifted bank
And we we got upsot
OH  Jingle bells jingle bells,
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells jingle bells
